## 📝 Description

Welcome to my project of a MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) library developed from scratch, similar to [Keras](https://keras.io/api/). This library allows you to create, train, and evaluate multilayer perceptron models.

For this project, I am using predictive data to diagnose cancer in cells, with M representing malignant and B representing benign

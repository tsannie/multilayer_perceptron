## 📝 Description

Welcome to my project of a MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) library developed from scratch, similar to [Keras](https://keras.io/api/). This library allows you to create, train, and evaluate multilayer perceptron models.

For this project, I am using predictive data to diagnose cancer in cells, with M representing malignant and B representing benign

## 📦 Features

### Optimizers

Optimizers play a crucial role by helping to minimize the loss function and find the optimal values for the model's parameters. They guide the learning process by adjusting the parameters iteratively based on the gradients, leading to improved accuracy and faster convergence during training.
